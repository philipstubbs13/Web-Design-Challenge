    description: 'This chart deals with video publish time. That is, the time when a content creator uploads a video to their channel. The publish time column  from the data set included both the time and the date, which required a little bit of cleaning and formatting to do this analysis. However, this project only looked at time of day. Something to perhaps look at later on is days of the week. From this visualization, one of the first things we can see is the relationship between average number of views and publish time in the US. From this visualization, we can see that the number of likes and comments hovers around 50,000 to 100,000 throughout the day. There are 2 major spikes seen in likes/comments. One is at 4 a.m. and the other is at 9 a.m. Another thing we can see from this visualization is the relationship  between number of trending videos and publish time. This is shown in the visualization with the green bars. We can see that a majority of these videos were published some time between 1 p.m. and 10 p.m., with the highest number of videos being published at 4 p.m. So, if a content creator were to consider when the best time to upload a video would be, the best times would be some time in the afternoon and would want to avoid publishing in the morning (unless they only care about increasing their engagement).'

    description: 'This visualization deals with video publish time outside of the US. For countries outside of the US, we can see that the average number of likes and comments are much lower than the US. We also see a steady increase in videos starting at 8 a.m. and peaking at about 4 p.m. This is the time period a content creator should consider when posting a video. They might also want to consider avoiding uploading between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. Overall, besides the spikes we see here at 4, 5, and 9 a.m., publish time does not look to have much of an effect for countries outside of the US as compared to the US.'

    description: 'This chart shows the YouTube categories that are most popular for US viewers. As shown by the chart, the top 3 categories for trending videos in the US are "Entertainment", "Music", and "How-to & Style." No single category consumes the majority (50 percent or more) of the trending videos list for the US. A diverse collection of category viewership is shown in the chart with the "Others" category, making up more than one third of the viewership. The "Others" category in the US includes 38 additional categories outside of the top five categories.'

Interestingly, there is no category that consumes the majority (50 percent or more) of the trending videos list for countries outside of the US. The chart shows a diverse collection of categories considering the addition of "Others", which includes 26 additional categories outside of the top five categories.'

From this visualization, we can see the important of using tags, as less than 5% of trending videos used no tags. As  result, the use of tags is strongly recommended when creating your next YouTube video.'

    description: 'Tags are descriptive keywords you add to your video to help viewers find your content. When users type keywords related to your tags, your video will appear in their search results. According to YouTube, tagging is one of the most important ways to rank your videos in their search. This visualization shows the most used tags for trending videos in the US. From this visualization, we see that the top 3 tags are significantly more used, drove more views, and also seem to be related to the Entertainment category. This project also looked at the most common tags for each category as some categories are likely to use certain tags more than others. Specifically, this project looked at the top 10 tags from the top 5 categories with the most trending videos.'
